# Overview

As systems engineers, we spend much of our time on our command-line terminals
interacting with a myriad of systems in support of the overarching infrastructure.

Our daily tasks can often be repetitive, 
which is why we often find ourselves utilizing 
or creating automation to lessen our keystrokes.

This brings us to a question:

- _What do you get when each member of a team of engineers has an affinity
  for creating their own little scripts to make their lives easier?_<br />
  Hint: It's something messy.
  
The *ops* tool aims to clean up this proclivity for command-line mess in the team setting
by unifying disparate pieces of automation into a single entrypoint, thus 
creating a homogenous command-line experience.

This is accomplished by a simple shell script that automatically discovers executables
organized in directories and creates wrapper scripts with dot-notation naming,
making them easily accessible from anywhere.

The following sections go over this in detail.

<a name="design"></a>
# Design

The *ops* tool is a bash/zsh-compatible shell script that:

- Scans directories recursively for executable files
- Automatically creates wrapper scripts for discovered executables
- Generates aliases for quick access to commands
- Supports namespace organization via configuration or git repository detection
- Creates a unified command index in YAML format

<a name="features"></a>
## Features

  - Commands are executables organized by subfolders in a scanned directory<br />
    (See the Appendix for list of supported executable types)
  - Subfolders are interpreted as namespace components for<br />
    the given scripts/executables contained therein
  - Subcommands follow a dot-notation style of reference, e.g.<br />
    _namespace.folder.subfolder.command_<sup> [1](#sub-command-naming-logic)</sup>
  - Automatic namespace detection from `.dot-commander.yaml` or git repository name
  - Automatic wrapper script generation in `${HOME}/dot-commander/bin`
  - Automatic alias generation for shell init files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`)

<a name="installation"></a>
# Installation

<a name="prerequisites"></a>
## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- **bash** or **zsh** shell
- **yq** - A YAML processor (for parsing command index)
  - Install via package manager:
    - macOS: `brew install yq`
    - Linux: `apt-get install yq` or `yum install yq`
    - Or download from [https://github.com/mikefarah/yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq)

<a name="ops"></a>
## Installing ops

### Quick Install (Recommended)

The easiest way to install ops is using the one-line installer:

```bash
bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/berttejeda/bert.dot-commander/master/binscripts/ops-installer)
```

This will:
- Download and install `ops` to `/usr/local/bin`
- Automatically initialize ops
- Update your shell profile files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or `.profile`)
- Set up the PATH configuration

After installation, reload your shell:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

1. **Clone or download the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berttejeda/bert.dot-commander.git
   cd bert.dot-commander
   ```

2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ops
   ```

3. **Add to your PATH** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Symlink to a directory in your PATH
   sudo ln -s $(pwd)/ops /usr/local/bin/ops
   
   # Option 2: Add the directory to your PATH
   # Add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
   export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/bert.dot-commander"
   ```

4. **Initialize ops**:
   ```bash
   ops ---init
   ```

   This will:
   - Create the dot-commander workspace directory at `${HOME}/dot-commander`
   - Add initialization blocks to your `~/.bashrc` and `~/.zshrc`
   - Set up the PATH to include `${HOME}/dot-commander/bin`

5. **Reload your shell** or source your init file:
   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
   ```

The next section will cover script organization and usage.

# Script Organization

ops works by scanning directories for executable files and creating wrapper scripts
that can be invoked using dot-notation.

<a name="creating-scripts"></a>
## Creating Scripts

Scripts are really easy to create - they are simply executable 
files organized into folders. The folder structure determines the command namespace.

You need only enough proficiency to write a script in bash, zsh, python, powershell, 
or any other language that supports shebangs (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env bash`).

**Requirements for scripts to be discovered:**

1. The file must be executable (`chmod +x script.sh`)
2. The file must have a shebang on line 1 (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/env bash`)
3. Files in `node_modules` and `.git` directories are automatically excluded

**Example script structure:**

```
~/scripts/
├── git/
│   ├── create-issue-branch.sh
│   └── get-bitbucketfile.ps1
├── k8s/
│   ├── trigger-rolling-update.sh
│   └── get-stats.sh
└── aws/
    └── query.py
```

<a name="scanning-directories"></a>
## Scanning Directories

To make your scripts available via ops, simply scan the directory containing them:

```bash
ops ---scan ~/scripts
```

This will:
- Initialize ops if not already done
- Scan `~/scripts` recursively for executable files
- Create wrapper scripts in `${HOME}/dot-commander/bin`
- Generate a command index in YAML format
- Create aliases in your shell init files

After scanning, you can view available commands:

```bash
ops ---help
```

And execute them using dot-notation:

```bash
ops git.create-issue-branch
ops k8s.trigger-rolling-update
ops aws.query
```

# Usage Examples

## Basic Usage

**Initialize ops:**
```bash
ops ---init
```

**Scan a directory for scripts:**
```bash
ops ---scan ~/my-scripts
```

**View available commands:**
```bash
ops ---help
```

**Execute a command:**
```bash
ops git.create-issue-branch feature/new-feature
```

**Execute a nested command:**
```bash
# For a file at ~/scripts/remote/dev/test.sh
ops remote.dev.test
```

## Namespace Configuration

**Using `.dot-commander.yaml`:**

Create a `.dot-commander.yaml` file in your scripts directory:

```yaml
namespace: 'myproject'
```

Then scan the directory:
```bash
ops ---scan ~/scripts
```

Commands will be prefixed with the namespace:
- `myproject.git.create-issue-branch`
- `myproject.k8s.trigger-rolling-update`

**Automatic Git Repository Detection:**

If your scripts directory is a git repository, ops will automatically use
the repository name as the namespace:

```bash
# If ~/scripts is a git repo named "my-automation"
ops ---scan ~/scripts
# Commands will be: my-automation.git.create-issue-branch, etc.
```

## Using Aliases

After scanning, aliases are automatically created in your shell init files.
You can use them directly:

```bash
ops.git.create-issue-branch feature/new-feature
```

# Appendix

<a name="sub-command-naming-logic"></a>
## Sub-Command Naming Logic

As mentioned in the previous sections, commands follow a dot-notation style of reference.

The naming convention works as follows:

1. **If a namespace is defined** (via `.dot-commander.yaml` or git repository):
   - Format: `namespace.folder.subfolder.command`
   - Example: `myproject.git.create-issue-branch`

2. **If no namespace is defined**:
   - Format: `folder.subfolder.command`
   - Example: `git.create-issue-branch`

3. **For nested paths**:
   - A file at `~/scripts/remote/dev/test.sh` becomes:
     - With namespace: `namespace.remote.dev.test`
     - Without namespace: `remote.dev.test`

4. **Files in the root of the scanned directory**:
   - Become `namespace.root.scriptname` (with namespace)
   - Or `root.scriptname` (without namespace)

### Supported Executable Types

ops supports any executable file with a shebang, including:

- **Shell scripts**: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, `#!/usr/bin/env zsh`, `#!/usr/bin/env sh`
- **Python scripts**: `#!/usr/bin/env python`, `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- **PowerShell scripts**: `#!/usr/bin/env pwsh`
- **Other interpreted languages**: Any executable with a valid shebang

Binary executables without shebangs are skipped during scanning.
